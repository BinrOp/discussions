# Discussions

In most repositories we want the issue to be actionable: a contributor should be able to come in, pick an issue, and do some work in order to close it.

This repository is for all the _other_ discussions, the ones where we need to inform everyone involved in the project about something, or figure out a policy about something, or make a decision of some sort. This is the repository for philosophical discussions, for asking clarifying questions, for discussing priorities.

The actual discussions can be found in the [issues](https://github.com/exercism/discussions/issues) section.

## Labels

We distinguish between **discussions about user-facing things** (on the website or in the command-line client) which we collectively call the _product_, and **discussions about the open source project** (policies, processes, organization), which we call the _project_.

We have labels for these:

- [concerning/product](https://github.com/exercism/discussions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aconcerning%2Fproduct)
- [concerning/open-source](https://github.com/exercism/discussions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aconcerning%2Fopen-source)
